4. Create a list of numbers. Add them together. First double each number, then add 
them up. Compute their average.



def numList=[22,53,4,42,66,36]

sumList=numList.sum()
println ("Sum of the Element is : " + sumList)

doubleList=numList.collect{it*2}
println ("Double the list Element : " + doubleList)

doubleSum=doubleList.sum()
println ("Sum After Doubling the list : " + doubleSum)

average=(sumList+doubleSum)/2
println ("Average of both the List : " + average)
